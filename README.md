# quarrel-bot-rl
This is the source code for an AI bot built for Rocket League. The proposal of this project is to create an aggressive bot based on the replays from a few professional players.

## Database
The database itself will be created by the creator of the project, it will contain 1v1 replays since 2020 from professional player that played official RLCS matches, also detailing when a goal occured and who scored it.

## AI Learning process
The main goal is for it to learn how to score goals on opponents, while also being able to defend, so the AI will learn how to play based on the next person that scores a goal. This can create some problems due to different playstyles from various players, but for now it isn't something the creator is worried about.
